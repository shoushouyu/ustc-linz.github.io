# About Me (Updated in 2025.2)

<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Hi, there. I am Zijie Lin (林子杰), a second-year master's student in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) & [Suzhou Institute for Advanced Study](https://sz.ustc.edu.cn/index.html) & [State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Intelligence](http://cogskl.iflytek.com/) at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC), supervised by Prof. [Mingjun Xiao](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xiaomj/indexEN.html).

My research interests include Natural Language Processing & Multi-agent Systems. I have published several academic papers in top-tier international conferences and journals, including IEEE INFOCOM, IEEE ICDCS, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, etc.


**I am seeking opportunities for Doctoral Researcher in 2026. If you are interested in my research, please don't hesitate to contact me: lzj741@mail.ustc.edu.cn**
